# Python Duplicate Images Finder
The goal is to find duplicate images via a beutiful web interface, where you can explore, select, move and delete single or a bunch of duplicate images from your computer.

Strong point of this software is [__pHash__](http://www.phash.org/): an open source software library that implements several perceptual hashing algorithms, and provides a C-like API. It ignores the image size and file size and instead creates a hash based on the pixels of the image. This allows you to find duplicate pictures that have been rotated, have changed metadata, and slightly edited.

This code is a full refactor of [this software](https://github.com/philipbl/duplicate-images), so thanks to @philipbl for the amazing work! :)

# Todo list
